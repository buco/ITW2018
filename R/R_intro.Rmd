## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. A document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
print('Hello World')
```

## Some data

R knows a lot of distributions, now let us generate some random midterm scores!

```{r}
scores <- rnorm(100, 50, 15)
```

## Including Plots

An R Markdown document is very handy if it comes to standard document formats, lets say you want to publish midterm results (very similar structure but different data). First we draw a histogram of the scores:

```{r hist}
hist(scores)
```

Well, the code is fairly simple, but we want to be stylish.

```{r hist2}
hist(scores,
     main = "First midterm results",
     ylab = "", 
     xlab = "points", 
     col = "cornflowerblue")
abline(v = mean(scores),
       col = "red",
       lwd = 2)
text(x = mean(scores), y = 5, 
     labels = round(mean(scores), 2),
     col = "red")
```

Somewhat nicer!
The aim however was only to introduce you to graphs and Rmd files. You can also hide the code just like here to present top three scores:

```{r top3, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
cat(round(tail(sort(scores), 3), 2))
```

Congratulations, now you know how to create a histogram and a document you can use multiple times!
